# Conway's Game of Life
> Week 02: Sinatra & TDD using RSpec

The Game of Life (an example of a cellular automaton) is played on a two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells _([Check Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life))_. The purpose of this exercise was to learn RSpec and practice Test Driven Development (TDD) in Ruby. Also, I tried to apply good object-oriented practices.
