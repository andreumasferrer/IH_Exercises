# Spotify Player 
> Week 05: Adanced Javascript, HTML5 APIs, Bootstrap & responsive design

This exercise was about creating an audio player by using the Spotify public API. Although we worked on more complex projects that week, I particulary enjoyed this one that played audio on the browser. In this project I practiced with Javascript, AJAX requests, JQuery, CSS & Bootstrap.
