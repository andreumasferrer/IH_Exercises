# Auctions Site
> Week 04: Ruby on Rails, MVC Architecture, Databases

My first attempt at a Rails app. I made simple auction site where users can submit products to sell and other users can bid on them. At the deadline set by the seller, the buyer with the highest bid wins the item. The goal in this exercise was to practice basic CRUD operations and understanding how Rails work.
